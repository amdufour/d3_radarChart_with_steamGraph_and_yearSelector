This project combines a d3 radar chart with a streamgraph, both triggered by a year selector.

The D3 radar chart was adapted from Nadieh Bremer.
The original chart code can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/nbremer/21746a9668ffdf6d8242#file-radarchart-js)

Boilerplate is from Chris Fernandi. Can be found [here](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gulp-boilerplate)

### To install
1. `cd` into the project root
2. Run `npm install` to install required files and dependencies.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
	- `gulp` manually compiles files.
	- `gulp watch` automatically compiles files and applies changes using [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) when you make changes to your source files.
